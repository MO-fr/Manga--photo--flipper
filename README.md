# 🎨 Greatest Manga Showcase Website

This project showcases three iconic works of fiction that I and many others adore. This showcase has visually themed containers, images, and links to dedicated pages. It's a perfect blend of **manga** and **anime** recommendations wrapped in a vibrant design.

## 🌟 Features

- **Responsive Design**: Built using `flexbox` for smooth alignment and responsive layouts.
- **Custom Containers**: Each image is housed in a styled box with:
  - Unique background colors that complement the theme of the fiction.
  - Rounded corners and shadows for a polished aesthetic.
- **Vertical Text**: A fun vertical text layout for descriptions on individual pages.
- **Embedded Links**: Links to videos or other relevant media to enhance the experience.

## 📁 Project Structure

- **HTML Files**:
  - `index.html`: The main page featuring three fictional works with images and links to individual pages.
  - `ippo.html`, `thorf.html`, `guts.html`: Dedicated pages for each fictional work, with a brief description and external video links.

- **CSS Files**:
  - `pulse.css`: Styles the main page and individual content pages, including background colors, flexbox-based layout, and more.

## 🎬 Demo Preview

- **Main Page**:
