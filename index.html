            I don’t usually give everything a 10/10, but this show is near perfect. Ippo’s growth from a nobody 
            to a talented boxer, along with the well-developed side characters, makes for an incredible journey. 
            I loved how even the opponent boxers had backstories that made them feel real and relatable. 
            The fight choreography and build-ups were outstanding, especially for its time.
            If you haven’t seen it, I highly recommend it. Easily one of the best sports anime out there—10/10 ... That video you see there encapsulates the emotion these fights give.
